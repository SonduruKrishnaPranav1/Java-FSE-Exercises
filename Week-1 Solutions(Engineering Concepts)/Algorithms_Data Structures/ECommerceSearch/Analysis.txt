Analysis Of Search Operations:

Algorithm     | Time Complexity | Use-Case                     

Linear Search | O(n)            | Unsorted or small datasets        
Binary Search | O(log n)        | Sorted datasets, frequent lookups 



Discussion:


Use-Case of Binary search:

Your product list is sorted (sort it once and maintain it).

You have frequent searches and performance is critical.



Use-Case of Linear search:

The product list is small or unsorted.

You donâ€™t want to incur the cost of sorting.
